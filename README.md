# PkgDeb

PkgDeb is a .deb file packager for `Mix Release`.

This is currently just a fork of distillery_packager for `Mix Release` so the code is quite messy but works.

In a future release the whole codebase will be revamped and slimmed down.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `pkg_deb` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pkg_deb, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/pkg_deb](https://hexdocs.pm/pkg_deb).
